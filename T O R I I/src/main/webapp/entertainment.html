            In Japan, music includes a wide array of distinct genres, both
            traditional and modern. The word for "music" in Japanese is 音楽
            (ongaku), combining the kanji 音 on (sound) with the kanji 楽 gaku
            (music, comfort). Japan is the world's largest market for music on
            physical media[citation needed] and the second-largest overall music
            market, with a retail value of US$2.7 billion in 2017.

            style to Japanese animation is commonly referred to as

            Main Stream of Modern Japanese Music (J-Pop and J-Rock)
          </h6><br>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            J-pop and J-rock are a musical genre that entered the musical
            mainstream of Japan in the 1990s. Modern J-pop and J-rock has its
            roots in traditional Japanese music, but significantly in 1960s pop
            and rock music, such as The Beatles and The Beach Boys, which led to
            Japanese rock bands such as Happy End fusing rock with Japanese
            music in the early 1970s. J-pop and J-rock were further defined by
            new wave groups in the late 1970s, particularly electronic synthpop
            band Yellow Magic Orchestra and pop rock band Southern All Stars.
            The terms were coined by the Japanese media to distinguish Japanese
            music from foreign music, and now refer to most Japanese popular
            music. The musical genre has been immensely influential in many
            other music styles, and hence those of neighboring regions, where
            the style has been copied by neighboring Asian regions, who have
            also borrowed the name to form their own musical identities.

            Strong Connection with Jamaican Reggae (Japanese Reggae)
          </h6><br>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            The first reggae band to perform in Japan was The Pioneers who
            toured in 1975. However it was not until 1979, when Jamaican singer
            Bob Marley visited Japan on holiday that reggae would gain momentum.
            Marley wanted to attend a concert by the Flower Travellin Band and
            when looking for information, he met famed Japanese percussionist
            "Pecker" who informed him that the group had already disbanded. The
            two became good friends, and Pecker suggested to Marley the
            collaboration between acclaimed Japanese and Jamaican artists. The
            albums featured Japanese artists Minako Yoshida, Ryuuichi Sakamoto,
            Naoya Matsuoka, Shigeharu Mukai, and Akira Sakata, alongside
            Jamaican artists Augustus Pablo, Sly & Robbie, The Wailers, Rico
            Rodriguez, Carlton Barrett and Marcia Griffiths. These two albums
            influenced both Japanese and Jamaican artists, and are regarded as
            spreading reggae to Japan.

            Uniquely Developed Jazz Scene in Japan (Japanese Jazz)
          </h6><br>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Japanese jazz refers to jazz music played by Japanese musicians, or
            jazz music that is in some way connected to Japan or Japanese
            culture. In a broader sense, the concept is often used to refer to
            the history of jazz in Japan. Japan has, according to some
            estimates, the largest proportion of jazz fans in the world.
            Attempts at fusing jazz music with aspects of Japanese culture in
            the United States are commonly termed Asian-American jazz. Japanese
            jazz had frequently been criticized as derivative, or even as an
            unworthy imitation of U.S. jazz, both by American and Japanese
            commentators. In response to the belittling attitude of their
            audience, Japanese jazz artists began adding a "national flavor" to
            their work in the 1960s. Expatriate Toshiko Akiyoshi drew on
            Japanese culture in compositions for the big band she co-led with
            her husband and long-term collaborator Lew Tabackin.

            One of a Kind Music Style of Japan (Japanoise)
          </h6><br>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Japanoise is a portmanteau of the words "Japanese" and "noise": a
            term applied to the diverse, prolific, and influential noise music
            scene of Japan. Primarily popular and active in the 1980s and 1990s
            but still alive today, the Japanoise scene is defined by a
            remarkable sense of musical freedom. Some of the most popular groups
            range from the high-energy free improv stylings of Hijokaidan, the
            punk demolition of Hanatarash and its subsequent psychedelic
            Boredoms evolutions, to the tabletop electronics of Incapacitants
            and Merzbow. Japanoise, and particularly harsh noise, as opposed to
            some other post-industrial related styles, is often much less
            aggressively "serious" image-based, being focused more on the sole
            act of "jamming" as hard, loud or ridiculously as possible.

          </h6><br>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            The opening and credits sequences of most anime television episodes
            are accompanied by Japanese pop or rock songs, often by reputed
            bands. They may be written with the series in mind, but are also
            aimed at the general music market, and therefore often allude only
            vaguely or not at all to the themes or plot of the series. Pop and
            rock songs are also sometimes used as incidental music ("insert
            songs") in an episode, often to highlight particularly important
            scenes. More often than not, background music is employed as an
            added flavor to series either to drive story plot lines or to simply
            to decorate particular scenes and animated sequences. Furthermore,
            some series offer all applied music available in the form of OST, or
            original soundtracks.

            Attractive Music of Worldwide Famous Game Titles (Game Music)
          </h6><br>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            The first game to take credit for its music was Xevious, also
            noteworthy for its deeply (at that time) constructed stories. Though
            many games have had beautiful music to accompany their gameplay, one
            of the most important games in the history of the video game music
            is Dragon Quest. Koichi Sugiyama got involved in the project out of
            pure curiosity and proved that games can have serious soundtracks.
            Until his involvement, music and sounds were often neglected in the
            development of video games and programmers with little musical
            knowledge were forced to write the soundtracks as well. Undaunted by
            technological limits, Sugiyama worked with only 8 part polyphony to
            create a soundtrack that would not tire the player despite hours and
            hours of gameplay. Another well-known author of video game music is
            Nobuo Uematsu. Even Uematsu's earlier compositions for the game
            series, Final Fantasy are being arranged for full orchestral score.

            Why is Anime & Manga so popular in Japan?
          </h6><br>
          <p class="text-white" style="text-align: justify">
            In the west, we associate anime with Japan and – almost – Japan with
            anime. It’s a massive part of their cultural industry – and is
            perhaps the country’s third-largest industry. This makes it,
            obviously, pretty mega, bringing in nearly twenty billion dollars a
            year.
            <br /><br />
            Yet, the success of anime across the world is one of the most
            amazing things about this genre. Apparently, sixty percent of all
            animated television shows across the world come from Japan. The
            anime industry in China is absolutely huge, whilst, in the west,
            various channels and services distributing anime have made it ever
            more popular.
            <br /><br />
            Over the years, channels like Cartoon Network – with Adult Swim and
            Toonami – and now anime streaming sites such as Crunchyroll and
            Funimation have brought this medium to an ever-growing audience.
            These days, over one hundred thousand people attend America’s annual
            anime convention.

          <p class="text-white" style="text-align: justify">
            Yet, so the history goes, Japanese anime was originally marketed
            incredibly aggressively to a global audience – precisely because
            there weren’t enough anime fans in Japan.
            <br /><br />
            But, now, anime is pretty much everywhere in that country. In 2014,
            2015, and 2016, six of the ten highest-grossing movies were anime,
            whilst Spirited Away remains the biggest-selling film in Japan.
            Seventy percent of Japanese DVD sales are also anime.
            <br /><br />
            Anime is visible everywhere. In adverts, in branding for water and
            snacks, on trains, school buses, and in airports. It has become a
            ubiquitous cultural force that has come to define the country
            itself.
            <br /><br />
            Yet, it goes without saying that not everyone likes it. And, even in
            the world of anime, many people are concerned about the
            commercialisation of the form. With every successful anime
            undergoing adaptation into a light novel, a live action film, video
            games, merchandise, music, and manga, the industry is sort of all
            encompassing.
            <br /><br />
            In the same way that Disney makes a lot of the products that it
            sells alongside the films themselves – there is a Pokémon theme park
            just as there is a Disneyland – anime does the same.
            <br /><br />
            And I’m sure you’ll agree that not everyone likes Disney.

            Which are Japan’s Most Popular Anime?
          </h6><br>
          <p class="text-white" style="text-align: justify">
            To identify a best anime, or even a most popular anime series, is a
            difficult task. This is because there are anime for young girls
            (known as shoujo anime), anime for teenage guys (shounen anime), and
            animes also for adults.
            <br /><br />
            This is the key to the success of the anime industry in Japan. But
            it also warns against treating anime like a monolithic thing.
            <br /><br />
            However, some anime are easy to point at and identify as extremely
            popular. Take the films of Studio Ghibli – Princess Mononoke and
            Spirited Away ­– which each in turn was the highest-grossing anime
            film ever. Until Spirited Away came out in China in 2019, Your Name,
            of 2016, was the biggest-selling anime film in Japan. So, this could
            be said to be pretty popular too.
            <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
            <strong class="text-success">Makoto Shinkai</strong> is a Japanese

            Shinkai studied Japanese literature at Chuo University where he was
            a member of juvenile literature club where he drew picture books. In
            1999, Shinkai released She and Her Cat, a five-minute short piece
            done in monochrome.

            Conventions, Celebrities, and Mainstream Cosplay
          </h6><br>
          <p class="text-white" style="text-align: justify">
            Even with its massive modern following, the uninitiated may be
            asking, what is cosplay exactly? Cosplay is the – now immensely
            popular – activity of wearing self-made costumes to represent
            beloved characters from various canon and fiction. Movies, TV shows,
            comic books, video games, manga, anime and more are all sources of
            inspiration for people that cosplay.
            <br /><br />
            The term cosplay itself, a contraction of costume and play, is
            typically credited to Nobuyuki Takahashi when he used the phrase in
            magazines back in 1984. Previously, the phrase ‘costuming’ was
            commonly used for the activity, since it has been around for at
            least 75 years at this point. It is believed that the history of
            cosplay started in the USA with several annual masquerade balls held
            at the science fiction themed Worldcon. It was at Worldcon in 1984,
            that Nobuyuki Takahashi was said to have first come across the
            concept and go on to coin the phrase ‘cosplay’.

            Although filmmaking styles have been altered for scaled-down
            financial resources and changing audience tastes, there's so much to
            recommend in Japan's current generation of filmmakers. Suo
            Masayuki's delightful Shall We Dance? (1996) was the
            highest-grossing foreign-language film ever to play in US movie
            theatres at the time.
            <br /><br />
            The anarchic, dark, violent and often funny ruminations by Takeshi
            'Beat' Kitano – a tremendously successful and popular comedian,
            actor, game-show host, raconteur and moviemaker – have won
            international acclaim, particularly the alternately tender and
            cataclysmic Hana-Bi (Fireworks), and Zatoichi, which won the Silver
            Lion award at Venice in 2003, as well as Outrage, which competed for
            the 2010 Palme d'Or in Cannes.

          <p class="text-white" style="text-align: justify">
            Japan's economic downturn of the 1990s produced even greater
            box-office revenues. Much of this is due to foreign films such as
            Titanic, but domestic product was also on the rise.
            <br /><br />
            Elsewhere there was scrutiny and criticism from the Japanese and
            international media with another film, Unmei no Toki (Pride), a
            big-budget, nationalistic biopic from director Ito Shunya that
            sympathetically portrayed Japan's wartime prime minister, General
            Tojo Hideki. A storm of controversy erupted around the region upon
            the film's release. Asians were incensed that the man generally
            considered to be the prime instigator of Japanese Asian aggression –
            and the person responsible for what has become known as the Rape of
            Nanjing – was depicted in the film to be battling for Asian
            interests against Western imperialism. Pride was made for a huge (by
            Japanese standards) US$11 million and starred the highly respected
            actor Tsugawa Masahiko as Tojo.
            <br /><br />
            Japanese films about World War II have always veered wildly between
            the powerfully pacifistic (Ichikawa Kon's harsh Fires on the Plain
            and the stunningly emotional The Burmese Harp, also directed by
            Ichikawa) and Jingoistic flag-waving. Often, war films try to have
            it both ways, especially in recent war movies in which popular teen
            idols, male and female, are cast in primary roles and then killed
            off tragically.

          <p class="text-white" style="text-align: justify">
            The claim that the Japanese enjoy nothing more than seeing
            themselves through the eyes of the outside world is corroborated by
            a glut of well-received Hollywood-made movies with Japanese
            locations and subjects. Hollywood had been fascinated with Japan as
            a setting for its dramas even before the 1958 John Wayne hit The
            Barbarian and the Geisha, or the 007 thriller You Only Live Twice,
            but the years around the turn of the millennium witnessed a Japan
            boom that seems unstoppable.
            <br /><br />
            Memorable films include Ridley Scott's Black Rain (1989), filmed in
            Osaka, where a thriving criminal underworld provided theme and
            visual substance, and Paul Schrader's Mishima (1985), which looked
            at the troubled but intriguing life of literary giant and right-wing
            imperialist Yukio Mishima.
            <br /><br />
            Quentin Tarentino's 2003 Kill Bill Volume 1 and its sequel Kill Bill
            Volume 2 were homages to the Japanese yakuza film; Tom Cruise's
            portrayal of a transplanted Americal Civil War veteran in The Last
            Samurai was a smash hit in Japan; Sophia Coppola's Oscar-winning
            comedy Lost in Translation, which nevertheless received some
            criticism for its dated view of the Japanese, was filmed almost
            entirely in a Tokyo hotel and picked up an Oscar in 2003. The 2005
            film version of Arthur Golden's novel Memoirs of a Geisha became a
            hit in Japan, where it was released under the title of its main
            character, Sayuri. Clint Eastwood's look at warfare from the
            American and Japanese perspective in Flags of Our Fathers and
            Letters from Iwo Jima (2006) are more sophisticated examples of how
            Japan continues to inspire Hollywood.

            The silver lining for Japan's silver screen after the erosion of the
            studio system has been more freedom for independent directors.
            Although many independent production companies have become
            mainstream now, their works are among the best being made today.
            Early film successes were Ichikawa Jun's Tokyo Lullaby and Iwai
            Shunji's 1996 Swallowtail, a story about mindless materialism in a
            fictional urban setting called Yen City. Addressing other
            shortcomings of contemporary existence are a number of thoughtful
            films by Kiyoshi Kurosawa, including the future-set Barren Illusion,
            the 2000 film Charisma and the later Tokyo Sonata, which addresses
            the dilemmas faced by an unemployed salaryman. His Journey to the
            Shore, a story about love and death, won the Un Certain Regard Award
            for Best Director at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival.
            <br /><br />
            Another serious take on society's shortcomings is Koreeda Hirokazu's
            drama about children switched at birth, Like Father, Like Son, which
            won the Jury Prize in Cannes in 2013. Kawase Naomi's Mourning Forest
            won the prestigious Grand Prix at Cannes in 2007, her second
            nomination for the award. Still the Water and Our Little Sister both
            competed for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival in 2014 and
            2015 respectively.
            <br /><br />
            Other films with serious themes and excellent casts are Bad Company
            (2001), the sombre I Just Didn't Do It (2006), All Around Us (2008)
            and Yamada Yoji's About Her Brother (2010). Yojiro Takita's
            life-affirming Departures, which took the prize for best foreign
            film at the Oscars in 2009, is set in a funeral parlour in Yamagata
            Prefecture. Narushima Izuru's award-winning Rebirth (2011), Ishii
            Yuya's The Great Passage (2013) about a dictionary editor, and
            Yamazaki Takashi's war drama The Eternal Zero (2013), depicting
            Kamikaze pilots, are some of the best films produced in recent
            years. Japanese directors are not renowned overseas for their
            comedies, but there are some exemplary films, like Uchida Kenji's A
            Stranger of Mine (2005), Naito Takasugu's The Dark Harbour (2009),
            and Yoshida Daihachi's The Kirishima Thing (2012). Writer-director
            Ogigami Naoko's 2010 feature Toilet, a light but delightful comedy
            about values and bonding in an insecure world, was made entirely
            English.

            Japan is one of the oldest civilizations and has a beautiful and
            diverse history. The stunning, diverse scenery with mountains and
            breathtaking views, which are much appreciated by the Japanese,
            offers so many different experiences that attract tourists from all
            corners of the world.

          <p class="text-secondary">
            Although Japan is accessible again, the country currently only
            permits leisure tourists to come in organized groups rather than as
            individuals.
