          <p class="text-secondary px-3 pb-5" style="text-align: justify">
            Japanese culture is ancient and is filled with rites and traditions
            to honor the family. Because Japan is an island country, it was able
            to moderate the influence of other cultures for centuries. This
            allowed a distinct culture and heritage to develop for the beautiful
            Land of the Rising Sun. Two major religions influence Japanese
            traditions and culture: Shintoism and Buddhism. Shintoism has been
            practiced in Japan for over 2,000 years. Simply said, Shintoism is
            the belief in kami (gods). Because Shintoism has a lot to do with
            rituals, some Japanese may not feel it is a religion at all, but
            rather a way to celebrate many of Japan’s social traditions. For
            this reason, Buddhism can be practiced right alongside Shinto
            customs.

            Hatsu Miyamairi: a Cultural Rite of Passage
          </h6><br>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Hatsu Miyamairi, or Omiyamairi, meaning “shrine visit,” is a
            precious family tradition for the close loved ones of a newborn
            baby. Parents or grandparents bring the baby to a Shinto shrine for
            this special rite of passage. Traditionally done 31 days after the
            birth of a boy and 33 days after the birth of a girl, this Japanese
            Shinto tradition shows gratitude for the birth of the child.
            <br /><br />
            Babies are dressed in a white kimono or special white dress and are
            most often carried by their grandmother. The shrine priest says a
            prayer for the health and happiness of the newborn.

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Seijin no Hi, or Coming of Age Day, is another rite of passage in
            Japanese culture. It welcomes into adulthood those who have turned
            age 20 and is held each year on the second Monday in January.
            <br /><br />
            Seijin no Hi has been practiced in Japan since AD 714, when a young
            prince dressed in new robes and changed his hairstyle to reflect his
            passage into adulthood.
            <br /><br />
            On this celebration day, new adults gather and enjoy encouraging

            The Obon Festival: a Festival of Japanese Culture
          </h6><br>
          <p style="text-align: justify">
            The Obon festival is a way the Japanese honor their ancestors. This
            three-day summer festival has been celebrated for more than 500
            years and takes place in July or August.
            <br /><br />
            This Japanese Buddhist tradition encourages people to return to
            their ancestral family home places and clean and visit the graves of
            their ancestors. The spirits of the ancestors are said to revisit
            the family altars. Gifts of food, alcohol, and flowers are often
            left on the gravestone and altar as a respectful gesture to those
            who have passed away.

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            Traditional Japanese homes have very distinctive elements that make
            them unique, such as rush-and-cloth flooring called tatami mats,
            sliding doors called fusuma, and a kamidana or butsudan, which are
            house altars or shrines.
            <br /><br />
            Home altars and shrines are for paying respect to ancestors and for
            worship. A Buddist often has a butsudan altar, which resembles a
            cabinet. Within the cabinet is usually a Buddha figurine,
            candlesticks, incense sticks, bells, and a place to leave offerings
            in the altar.
            <br /><br />
            A kamidana is a miniature Shinto shrine in the home. Amulets or
            talismans are placed inside the shrine. As in traditional shrines
            found in a city or town, a rope hangs across the top, with white
            pieces of paper hanging from it. This rope and paper show the kami,
            or god, the purity of shrine. You may also see vases, candlesticks,
            and white dishes for offerings of water, sake, and food.

            <p style="text-align: justify">
              A simple yet extremely useful kitchen appliance consisting of a
              heat source, cooking bowl and thermostat — the first electric rice
              cookers (suihanki) — were produced by Mitsubishi Electric
              Corporation in 1945. Unfortunately, they weren’t very
              user-friendly back then as there was no automatic turn-off
              facility, which meant the rice required constant supervision. In
              1956, Yoshitada Minami invented a practical rice cooker with a
              thermostat that switched off automatically and thus prevented the
              rice from burning.
              <br /><br />
              Toshiba started selling the cookers and within four years, they
              could be found in around half of Japanese households. Today, it is
              a Japanese kitchen staple.

            At 6 am on October 1, 1964 two bullet trains (dangan ressha) left
            simultaneously from Tokyo and Shin-Osaka stations, marking the
            inauguration of the 0 Series Shinkansen. Launched nine days before
            the Tokyo Olympics opening ceremony, these trains reached speeds of
            up to 130 miles per hour (210 kph), making it possible to get from
            the capital to Osaka in around four hours, almost three hours
            shorter than the conventional limited express.
            <br /><br />
            Today that journey can be done in two and a half hours on the Nozomi
            bullet train with a top speed of close to 200 miles per hour. (320
            kph).

            The story of quartz crystal as a timekeeping instrument began in
            1880 when Pierre Curie (Marie’s future husband) and his younger
            brother Jacques discovered its piezoelectric properties. The first
            quartz clock was built by Bell Laboratories 47 years later, proving
            much more accurate than its mechanical counterpart. The next big
            challenge was squeezing all the components of the clock into a
            wristwatch. No easy feat.
            <br /><br />
            Seikosha became the first company to achieve that with the release
            of the Seiko Quartz Astron on Christmas Day, 1969, a date that is
            etched in the annals of horological history.

            Wanting to help a friend who was slowly going blind, Seiichi Miyake
            used his money to create tactile bricks (also known as tenji blocks)
            so visually impaired pedestrians could be alerted to upcoming
            dangers such as pavement curbs or platform edges at train stations.
            Developed in 1965, the yellow bumpy surfaces, featuring dots and
            bars, were installed along a highway near a school for the blind in
            Okayama two years later.
            <br /><br />
            The following decade, all Japan National Rail platforms were
            mandated to include the invention. Tactile paving eventually became
            commonplace in western countries in the 1990s.

            Known as the inventor of karaoke, Daisuke Inoue was described in
            Time magazine as “one of the most influential Asians of the 20th
            Century.” In 1971, his band provided back-up music at clubs for
            businessmen wanting to take to the stage. Asked by a client to
            accompany him on a business trip in 1971, he was unable to attend.
            Instead, however, he supplied a recorded tape.
            <br /><br />
            Realizing its potential, the drummer made a karaoke machine out of a
            car stereo, coin box and amplifier that he then rented to bars in
            Kobe. As he didn’t patent the invention, Inoue missed out on
            millions. You can even enjoy karaoke while also riding one of
            Japan’s state-of-the-art trains.

            cassette player that revolutionized the way people listened to
            music.
            <br /><br />
            The organization’s co-founder Masaru Ibuka, tired of lugging around
            the bulky TC-D5 cassette recorder on business trips, asked executive
            deputy president Norio Ohga to design a playback-only stereo version
            optimized for headphone use (the original device had two earphone
            jacks so two people could listen at once).
            <br /><br />
            Predicted to sell around 5,000 units monthly, it sold upwards of

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            When tourists visit Japan, one of the first things they usually
            mention is how amazing the toilets are here. Toto is the company
            responsible for these innovative lavatories that feature automatic
            lids, heated seats and music to hide any embarrassing noises. It was
            the creation of the washlet in 1980 that ushered in this new era of
            high-tech toilets.
            <br /><br />
            The idea was to integrate electric seats with bidet functions,
            featuring a nozzle that extends and retracts at exactly 43 degrees,
            known as the “golden angle.” The temperature of the water is always
            warm, allowing for optimum comfort.

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            In 2014, Shuji Nakamura, an American citizen born and raised in
            Japan, along with two Japanese scientists, Isamu Akasaki and Hiroshi
            Amano, won the Nobel Prize in physics for the invention of blue
            light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Their accomplishment in 1992 solved a
            long-standing issue that proved extremely challenging for
            scientists.
            <br /><br />
            Though green and red LEDs had been around for many years, without
            the blue diodes, it wouldn’t have been possible to produce the white
            light we see in LED-based computer and TV screens today. Lighting is
            now more energy-efficient and cost-effective.

          <p style="text-align: justify">
            An anglicized version of two Japanese words meaning “picture
            character,” emojis first appeared in Japan at the end of the 20th
            Century. The SkyWalker DP-211 SW, released by Softbank (then known
            as J-Phone) on November 1, 1997, was believed to be the first mobile
            phone to feature the pictograms. There were 90 in total, all in
            black in white, including the iconic poop symbol.
            <br /><br />
            Two years later, Shigetaka Kurita designed a set of 176 cartoon-like
            images in color using a 12 by 12 pixels canvas for Docomo. There are
            now more than 3,000 emojis in the Unicode Standard. The “face with
            tears of joy” is said to be the most frequently used emoji.

            Japan is one of the oldest civilizations and has a beautiful and
            diverse history. The stunning, diverse scenery with mountains and
            breathtaking views, which are much appreciated by the Japanese,
