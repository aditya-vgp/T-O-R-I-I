The reason the zip files are in volumes are because of a number of downloaded videos were used in the webpages. (And my upload limit for each file is 25mb)

You will get the full project working once all the files are extracted.

I'm attaching a sample file called "index.html" to show how the design may look. Hope you like it! :)
